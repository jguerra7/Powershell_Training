```
### TASK 1
Run a command that will display the newest 100 entries from the Application event log. Do not use Get-WinEvent.

### TASK 2
Write a command line that displays only the five top processes based on virtual memory (VM) usage.

### TASK 3
Create a CSV file that contains all services, including only the service name and status. Have running services listed before stopped services.

### TASK 4
Write a command line that changes the startup type of the BITS service to Manual.

### TASK 5
Display a list of all files named win*.* on your computer. Start in the C:\ folder. Note: you may need to experiment and use some new parameters of a cmdlet in order to complete this task.

### TASK 6
Get a directory listing for C:\Program Files. Include all subfolders and files. Direct the directory listing to a text file named C:\Dir.txt (remember to use the > redirector, or the Out-File cmdlet).

### TASK 7
Get a list of the 20 most recent entries from the Security event log, and convert the information to XML. Do not create a file on disk: Have the XML display in the console window.

Note that the XML may display as a single top-level object, rather than as raw XML data—that’s fine. That’s just how PowerShell displays XML. You can pipe the XML object to Format-Custom to see it expanded out into an object hierarchy, if you like.

### TASK 8
Get a list of all event logs on the computer, selecting the log name, its maximum size, and overflow action, and then convert to CSV, but without writing to a log file. You may need to discover another CSV related cmdlet.

### TASK 9
Get a list of services. Keep only the services’ names, display names, and statuses, and send that information to an HTML file with a title of “Service Report”. Have the phrase “Installed Services” displayed in the HTML file before the table of service information. 
```
If you can, display Installed Services with an <H1> html tag. Verify the file in a web browser.
```
### TASK 10
Create a new alias, named D, which runs Get-ChildItem. Export just that alias to a file. Now, close the shell and open a new console window. Import that alias into the shell. Make sure you can run D and get a directory listing.

### TASK 11
Display installed hotfixes that are either ‘Hotfix’ or ‘Update’, but not Security Update.

### TASK 12
Run a command that will display the current directory that the shell is in.

### TASK 13
Run a command that will display the most recent commands that you have run in the shell. Locate the command that you ran for task 11. Using two commands connected by a pipeline, rerun the command from task 11.

In other words, if Get-Something is the command that retrieves historical commands, 5 is the ID number of the command from task 11, and Do-Something is the command that runs historical commands, run this:

Get-Something    id 5 | Do-Something
Of course, those aren’t the correct cmdlet names—you’ll need to find those. Hint: both commands that you need have the same noun.

### TASK 14
Run a command that modifies the Security event log to overwrite old events as needed.

### TASK 15
Use the New-Item cmdlet to make a new directory named C:\Review. This is not the same as running Mkdir; the New-Item cmdlet will need to know what kind of new item you want to create. Read the help for the cmdlet.

### TASK 16
Display the contents of this registry key:

HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders
Note: “User Shell Folders” is not exactly like a directory. If you change into that "directory," you won’t see anything in a directory listing. User Shell Folders is an item, and what it contains are item properties. There’s a cmdlet capable of displaying item properties (although cmdlets use singular nouns, not plural).

### TASK 17
Find (but please do not run) cmdlets that can...

Restart a computer
Shut down a computer
Remove a computer from a workgroup or domain
Restore a computer’s System Restore checkpoint
### TASK 18
What command do you think could change a registry value? Hint: it’s the same noun as the cmdlet you found for task 16.
