# Powershell_Training

Windows PowerShell is the command and scripting language from Microsoft built into all versions of Windows since Windows Server 2008. Although PowerShell is new and different (or has new features you haven’t yet explored), it’s been designed to make use of what you already know, making it easy to learn. It’s also designed to allow you to learn a bit at a time.

In this Windows PowerShell training course, you will learn how to use this task-based command-line shell and scripting language, built on the .NET framework, designed especially for systems administration. This course is designed for the absolute beginner, meaning no prior experience with Windows PowerShell is needed.
You will start by learning the basics of PowerShell, then jump into installing and setting up PowerShell. From there, you will learn the PowerShell commands, including objects and classes, get-help, and get-command. You will also learn about PowerShell scripts, modules, functions, and how to setup automation tasks and schedules.
